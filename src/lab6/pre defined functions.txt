         Pre-defined Functions
Some operations are so common in programming, that the developers of the language build pre-defined functions to do those operations. The C++ language comes with several libraries of pre-defined functions. You can consider these functions as "black boxes". You don't need to know how they work. You just need to know what parameters to give to the function, and what kind of value the functions will give you back. The table below lists a number of common mathematical functions that you will often use in your programs. 

Function #include Purpose Parameter
Types Return
Type 
abs(x) <cstdlib> Returns the absolute value of x int int 
ceil(x) <cmath> Returns the smallest whole number that is greater than x double double 
cos(x) <cmath> Returns the cosine of the angle x, where x is in radians
Similar functions exist for other trig functions. double double 
exp(x) <cmath> Returns ex double double 
fabs(x) <cmath> Returns the absolute value of x double double 
floor(x) <cmath> Returns the largest whole number smaller than x double double 
pow(x,y) <cmath> Returns xy double double 
rand( ) <cmath> Returns a pseudo random number   double 
sqrt(x) <cstdlib> Returns the square root of x double double 
srand(x) <cstdlib> Seeds the random number generator with x double
