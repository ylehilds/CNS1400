         Programming Exercise: C++ Input and Output
Introduction
In this lab, you will write a C++ program that does input and output. Before doing this exercise, you should review the reading material assigned for this lab and do the learning exercises on the worksheet. As you create this program, think carefully about the code that you are writing. What does each line of code do? 

Creating the Project
Follow these steps to create the project for this exercise: 

Before starting MinGW, be sure that you have created a folder in which to store your CNS 1250 work. 
Inside this folder, create a folder for this lab. Name it Lab02. 
Now, start up the MinGW Development Studio on your computer. 
Start a new Project and store it in the folder that you created for this project. 
Name the project lab02. 
Create a new C++ source code file. Name it Lab02.cpp. 
Now, type in the lines of C++ source code shown below. Pay attention to the spacing and indentation used in the code. Substitute your own name and course information where appropriate. You must supply your own code in the section marked. Refer to the code you worked with in the Learning Exercises if you need help. When you are done, save the file. 
Build and run your project. If you have compiler errors, inspect your code to make certain that you typed it in exactly as it is here. 
// Lab Two Programming Exercise
// CNS 1250
// Roger deBry
// CNS 1250 Section 001
// --------------------------

 
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std; 
 
int main( )
{
    // declarations
    string name;
    int age;
    float value;

    // Here you must supply code that does the following:
    // Prompt the user to enter their full name
    // Get their name and store it in the variable name
    // Prompt the user for their age
    // Get their age and store it in the variable age
    // Prompt the user for how much money they have
    // Get the amount of money and store it in the variable value
    // Now display the following:
    //    The person's name. You must display the full name
    //    The person's age
    //    The amount of money the person has. Display two digits 
    //    after the decimal point.
    system("PAUSE");
    return 0;
} 

Submitting Your Program
Now that you have a running program, it is time to submit your assignment for grading. The process for submitting a program for grading is as follows. Failure to follow these instructions when submitting your programs may result in your project not being graded, or being penalized points for missing or incorrect items. Submissions must include 

Your source code (.cpp) file, an executable file (.exe), and your completed worksheet. Do not send other files, for example .bpr, .tds, etc. 
Your name, course/section number, instructor name, and date must be included as comments in each source code file. 
Create a zip file containing your source code file (lab02.cpp), your executable file (lab02.exe), and your completed worksheet. Remember that your executable must run in the lab, in order for you to receive a grade on this assignment. If you do not know how to zip a file, consult with one of the tutors or lab assistants. Your zip file must be named as follows:
 
   lab02your-initials.zip
 
So, for example, my zip file would be named 
 
   lab02rkd.zip
 


Upload your zip file to WebCT.
