         Arrays and Vectors
From the programmer's point of view, arrays and vectors provide nearly equivalent function. The major advantage of using a vector is that the size of the vectors grows as required. The following table compares the properties of arrays and vectors.

Property Arrays Vectors 
Data Type All elements must be of the same data type All elements must be of the same data type 
Storage Elements are stored in consecutive memory locations Elements are stored in consecutive memory locations 
Fixed in Size Yes No, push_back operation will cause the size of the vector to increase, if necessary 
Random Access Yes, using the [ ] operator Yes, using the [ ] operator 
Insertion in the Middle Expensive Expensive 
Boundary Checking No No
