         De Morgan's Law
Suppose that you need to test a set conditions to see if they are all not true. For example, you want to go to work if it is not Saturday, Sunday, or a Holiday. The code to make this test might look something like 

   if ( ! (today == "Sunday" || today == "Saturday" || today == "Holiday")
       cout << "\nGo to Work!"; 

Sometimes the use of the not operator can be confusing when applied to and and or conditions like this. The British Mathemetician Augustus De Morgan (1806 - 1871) developed a scheme for simplifying expressions that use the not operator. De Morgan's Law has two forms: 

    ! ( A && B)     is the same as !A || !B
    ! ( A || B)     is the same as !A && !B


So, in the formulation of our code, we could equally as well have written 

   if ((today != "Sunday" && today != "Saturday" && today != "Holiday")
       cout << "\nGo to Work!";
