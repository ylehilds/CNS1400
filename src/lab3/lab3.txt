         CNS 1400: Lab Three

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:
This lab has several objectives: 

To help you understand how expressions are evaluated in C++ 
Operator precedence 
How and when conversions are done 
The increment and decrement operators 
To provide you with some tools for problem solving and algorithm design 
After completing this lab, you should be able to come up with solutions to simple computational problems and represent those solutions in activity diagrams. You should be able to write a C++ program that correctly uses the basic arithmetic operators and demonstrates your understanding of implicit data conversions done by the compiler and operator precedence.
